Anbagam was established by TERDOD, a Public Charitable Trust in 1999. Initially it was in the residence of our founder in Chennai city. Later it was shifted to the present premises at Vichur, Tirunilai. There are now approximately 450 mentally ill destitutes and abandoned senior citizens.

During 2013, TERDOD and Corporation of Chennai had entered into an agreement to run a rehabilitation centre at the CD Hospital, Tondiarpet. There also, facilities that are available in Anbagam is provided.

# For over a decade

We have been saving lives.

Why is it that once some people cross the thin line between mental health and mental illness, it is as though they have crossed over to another world where they are all alone and from which they can never return?

Anbagam rescues or takes in mentally ill destitute, helps them regain mental health, and reunites them with their families and communities.

At its centres in OTTERI & CDH TONDIARPET (CHENNAI), THIRUNILAI (THIRUVALLUR DISTRICT), DEVANDAVAKKAM(THIRUVALLUR DISTRICT) TAMILNADU, TERDOD cares for approximately 450 men and women.

# For over a decade

We have been saving several lives

Why is that once some people from amongst us cross the thin line between mental health and mental illness, it is as though they have crossed over to another world where they are all alone, from which they can never return? Anbagam rescues or takes in mentally ill destitute, helps them regain mental health, and reunites them with the families and the communities they were a part of. 

At its centres in OTTERI & CDH TONDIARPET ( CHENNAI), THIRUNILAI (THIRUVALLUR DISTRICT), DEVANDAVAKKAM(THIRUVALLUR DISTRICT) TAMILNADU , TERDOD , cares for approximately 450 men and women .

# Anbagam need your support for extended activities to rehabilitate people

Anbagam is a home for the mentally ill, orphans and Destitutes who wander on the streets of Chennai, since 21 years, founded and run by TERDOD, a nonprofit, Public Charitable Trust. In this period, Anbagam has rescued mentally ill persons, both men and women from the streets and they have been given proper medical and psychiatric treatment, were rehabilitated and some reunited with their families.

Anbagam has been recognized by the Government of Tamilnadu as one of the psychiatric rehabilitation centers for Chennai, Thiruvallur and Kancheepuram districts. Since May 2013, Corporation of Chennai has recognized Anbagam and authorized us to run one of the night shelters located at Communicable Diseases Hospital, Tondiarpet.

Taking care of so many mentally ill people is a challenge to us. We have successfully done it for the past 21 years because of you, our donors, who have supported us whole heartedly. Now again we come back to you for inspiration and support.
